# Coffee machine simulation using OOP (Object-oriented programming)

This program implements basic coffee machine functionality in this project using python OOP. If you run the main file, it imports all necessary classes from the other Python files and asks you to choose a coffee from the list. Once you enter your choice, it asks you to enter various types of coins in USD standard. The program serves you coffee if the entered coins are enough to fulfill the price. If the money is insufficient or there is not enough ingredient in the coffee machine, the program notifies you and returns the money. 

Enjoy your coffee!
